# fisico-frontend-mvp
A Minimal Viable Product Version of the Fisico Frontend App.  (For CSCE 482 Capstone Project)

### Environment Set Up Instructions
1. Install Node.js & NPM https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. Install Yarn (Optional, but Recommended) https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable
3. Install Expo. **Use Expo CLI Quickstart)** (Required) https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
4. Install Expo Go App on Your Phone (iOS & Android Both Available) https://expo.io/

**At this point, your environment should about be setup for working with react-native apps**
*You can follow more tutorials for initializing expo projects if you want*

### Running the App
A few things are required to run the app. This process likely will need to be followed
every time new modules are added to the repo. 

**If you haven't already, clone this repo to your computer**
1. cd into <Some Path>\fisico-frontend\fisico-app
2. yarn install / npm install (This will automatically install all node modules needed for the project onto your system)
3. yarn start / npm start (This will run the frontend server)
4. At this point you should see a barcode that you can scan with the expo app to run the application!

*Occasionally, the expo app fails. The best way to fix this is to restart the expo app and frontend server and try again*
